In this project I develop a solution  for the Vehicle Routing Problem using genetic algorithms.
I learned about DEAP libary and used  it in the project
I also learned about Matplotlib.Employed Matplotlib for visualizing complex routing solutions, facilitating effective data communication and decision-making.
It was my first Machine Learing Project and Introduction to genetic alogritms.I learn how to create Individual & Population for genetic algorithms.I also implement selection,crossover and mutation process in the 
solution with the help of DEAP Libary.
