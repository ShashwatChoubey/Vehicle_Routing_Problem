Project Description
In this project, I developed a solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem using genetic algorithms.
Key Learning:
DEAP Library: I learned about the DEAP library and used it in the project for implementing genetic algorithms.
Matplotlib: I also learned about Matplotlib and employed it for visualizing complex routing solutions, facilitating effective data communication and decision-making.
Introduction to Genetic Algorithms: This was my first machine learning project and introduction to genetic algorithms. I learned how to create individuals and populations for genetic algorithms and implemented selection, crossover, and mutation processes with the help of the DEAP library.
